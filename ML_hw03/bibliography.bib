	abstract = {Book Description: Gilbert Strang's textbooks have changed the entire approach to learning linear algebra -- away from abstract vector spaces to specific examples of the four fundamental subspaces: the column space and nullspace of A and A'. Introduction to Linear Algebra, Fourth Edition includes challenge problems to complement the review problems that have been highly praised in previous editions. The basic course is followed by seven applications: differential equations, engineering, graph theory, statistics, Fourier methods and the FFT, linear programming, and computer graphics. Thousands of teachers in colleges and universities and now high schools are using this book, which truly explains this crucial subject.},
